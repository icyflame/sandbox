In an early indication today that the Congress would launch an all-out attack on Mr Modi, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said at a rally in Jammu and Kashmir, "We don't know how many elections he has fought, but for the first time he has written that he is married. In Delhi, they talk about respecting women... but his wife's name never found its way into the affidavit." (Read: Rahul Gandhi targets Narendra Modi over admission of marriage)

This is a political article.
